# Book Management API

A robust and scalable REST API for managing books and authors, built with NestJS. This project is configured with industry best practices for security, performance, and developer experience.

---

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books and authors.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation powered by **Swagger (OpenAPI)**.
- **Validation**: Request validation using `class-validator` and `class-transformer`.
- **Security**:
  - **Helmet**: Secures the app by setting various HTTP headers.
  - **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute-force attacks.
  - **Input Sanitization**: Protects against XSS attacks.
- **Performance**:
  - **Response Compression**: Gzip compression for faster responses.
  - **Caching**: **Redis**-based caching for frequently requested data.
  - **Database Indexing**: Optimized database queries with indexes.
- **Observability**:
  - **Request Logging**: Detailed HTTP request logging with `morgan`.
  - **Error Tracking**: Integrated with **Sentry** for real-time error monitoring.
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring application status.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or npm/yarn)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for running services)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd book-management-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and fill in your database credentials, Redis connection info, and other environment-specific variables.

### 4. Run Database and Redis (Optional: Using Docker)

If you have Docker installed, you can easily start PostgreSQL and Redis services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
*(Note: A `docker-compose.yml` file would need to be created for this.)*

### 5. Run Database Migrations

This project uses TypeORM's `synchronize` feature for development, which automatically syncs your entities with the database. For production, a proper migration strategy is recommended.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with live-reloading:

```bash
pnpm run start:dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Mode

To build and run the application for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start:prod
```

---

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests
pnpm run test

# Run end-to-end (e2e) tests
pnpm run test:e2e

# Get a test coverage report
pnpm run test:cov
```

---

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive Swagger API documentation at:

**`http://localhost:3000/docs`**

This UI allows you to view all available endpoints, see their request/response formats, and execute API calls directly from your browser.

### API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

- **Authors**
  - `GET /authors` - Get all authors (with pagination and search)
  - `GET /authors/:id` - Get a single author by ID
  - `POST /authors` - Create a new author
  - `PATCH /authors/:id` - Update an author
  - `DELETE /authors/:id` - Delete an author

- **Books**
  - `GET /books` - Get all books (with pagination, search, and author filter)
  - `GET /books/:id` - Get a single book by ID
  - `POST /books` - Create a new book
  - `PATCH /books/:id` - Update a book
  - `DELETE /books/:id` - Delete a book

- **Health**
  - `GET /health` - Check the health status of the application and its database connection.
